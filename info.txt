The Linear Algebra JPractice application is a Java-based software system for students to practice linear algebra. 
It is reccomended to be used to reinforce concepts that are learned in class.
The system includes multiple different views which be selected using the tabs located along the top of the application window. 
These allow the student to focus on practicing a particular skill.


== INVERSE PRACTICE ==
The inverse practice tab is for practicing the important skill of computing the inverses of matrices. 
A matrix is displayed, and an interface is provided to input its inverse. 
Linear Algebra JPractice Software will then validate if it is in fact the correct value, and print the corresponding message. 


== MULTIPLICATION PRACTICE ==
This tab is for practicing the fundamental skill of matrix multiplication. Two matrices are displayed and the user inputs their product.
Feedback will then be given about the validity of the product matrix input.


== RANK PRACTICE ==
This tab allows for a student to practice finding the rank of a matrix. A matrix is displayed, and the student is to input the value of the rank of the matrix.
The rank should be input as a natural number. The program reports back if the rank has been computed correctly

== PRACTICE QUIZ ==
This provides an experience that is more similar to that of taking a quiz or test. In this tab, the student is presented with a series of questions.
These questions cover a range of topics that are essential to a linear algebra student. 
The question bank includes questions that cover the concepts of:

- Rank & Nullity
- Determinants
- Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors
- Linear Transformations
- Vector Spaces
- Subspaces
- Span & Basis

The questions vary between true/false, multiple-choice, and numeric free-response. 
This provides a varied experience that may more closely match actual assignments.
The questions are generated randomly from a bank. after each question, the user is told if they are correct or incorrect.
If they are incorrect, the correct answer is shown. Additionally, a running score is kept and displayed after every submitted question

== LICENSE & INFO ==
These tabs display information about the program and how to use it, including this help file and the program license
